*gly.pdb (glyXgly) and *ala.pdb (alaXala): tripeptides for residues except terminal residues
#All peptides were built in extended conformation (dihedral angles = 180^o) using insightII.

*gly.pep (Xgly) and *ala.pep (Xala.pep): dipeptides for N-terminal residues
gly*.pep (glyX) and ala*.pep (alaX.pep): dipeptides for C-terminal residues
